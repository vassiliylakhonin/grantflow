GIZ Technical Cooperation Results Guidance (Seed)

Purpose
This seed note summarizes practical design principles often used in GIZ-style technical cooperation projects.

Core logic
- Define a realistic programme objective linked to institutional performance and service quality.
- Translate the objective into implementable outputs that partner institutions can own.
- Use outcomes that describe partner behavior change and adoption of new routines.

Implementation quality criteria
- Co-design implementation plans with partner institutions and document ownership roles.
- Sequence capacity development, pilot implementation, and institutionalization steps.
- Include adaptation checkpoints when assumptions change.

Monitoring expectations
- Track output completion, quality of application, and institutional uptake over time.
- Prefer indicators that partners can report through routine systems.
- Document assumptions and sustainability factors in each review cycle.
