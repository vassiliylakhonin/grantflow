GIZ Sustainability and Partner Capacity Framework (Seed)

Sustainability dimensions

- Technical: trainers and service teams maintain competencies after project support.

Capacity strengthening principles
- Embed coaching and peer learning in implementation cycles.
- Transition responsibilities progressively to partner institutions.
- Validate operational readiness before scale-up.

Risk management cues

- Policy or governance shifts can delay institutional adoption.
