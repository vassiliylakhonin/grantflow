Responsible AI and digital governance guidance for public sector capacity building (seed)

Scope
This seed guide supports retrieval for projects training civil servants on AI use in policy and service delivery contexts. Replace with organization-approved or official guidance in production.

Core principles for public sector AI capacity building
- Human oversight: AI-assisted outputs must be reviewed by responsible officials before operational use.
- Purpose limitation: approved use cases should have a defined administrative or service objective.
- Data minimization: use only necessary data for training and pilots.
- Privacy and security: align with agency data protection and information security requirements.
- Transparency: document when and how AI tools were used in workflows.
- Accountability: assign owners for validation, approval, and monitoring.
- Inclusion and accessibility: ensure training and deployment do not worsen service inequities.

Training curriculum components
- AI literacy for public administration
- Safe prompt and workflow design
- Quality assurance and verification of AI-assisted outputs
- Bias, fairness, and inclusion considerations
- Data governance and records management
- Risk identification and escalation

Operational safeguards for pilot use cases
- Approved use cases list and exclusion list
- SOP for testing in non-production or supervised environments
- Review checklist for policy notes, citizen communications, and service content
- Incident logging and corrective action protocol

Suggested indicators for responsible AI adoption
- Percentage of trained staff passing post-training competency assessments
- Number of pilot units adopting approved AI-use SOPs
- Share of AI-assisted outputs reviewed and approved by supervisors
- Number of documented incidents or policy deviations and response time
- Improvement in processing time or consistency for selected administrative tasks

Risk flags in project design
- Training without adoption support
- Tool access restrictions not addressed
- No documentation standards for AI-assisted outputs
- No focal points or governance owners
