Civil service AI competency framework (seed)

Purpose
This seed framework supports retrieval for capacity-building proposals focused on public sector AI skills. Replace with official competency frameworks or training standards where available.

Competency domains
1. Foundational AI literacy
- Understand basic AI capabilities and limitations
- Distinguish generative AI from analytics and automation tools
- Recognize appropriate and inappropriate use cases

2. Public sector workflow application

- Escalate risks and suspected misuse

4. Evidence and verification
- Verify factual claims and data references
- Cross-check outputs against approved sources and internal guidance
- Track errors and corrective actions

5. Change management and adoption
- Support team adoption through SOPs and peer coaching
- Participate in learning reviews and process improvement cycles
- Report performance improvements and implementation constraints

Role-based proficiency levels (illustrative)
- Level 1 (General staff): safe use, verification, escalation
- Level 2 (Supervisors/process owners): workflow design, QA, approvals
- Level 3 (Focal points/trainers): SOP design, coaching, monitoring, governance coordination

Suggested learning evidence
- Pre/post knowledge assessment
- Applied assignments using agency workflow examples
- Supervisor verification of pilot output quality
- SOP adoption and compliance spot checks
