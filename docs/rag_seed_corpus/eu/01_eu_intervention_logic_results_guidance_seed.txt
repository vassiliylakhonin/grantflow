EU intervention logic and results framework guidance (seed summary)

Purpose
This seed summary supports retrieval for EU-style intervention logic drafting (overall objective, specific objectives, outputs, indicators, assumptions). Replace with official EU/EuropeAid guidance in production.

Typical intervention logic structure
- Overall objective (long-term change and rationale)
- Specific objectives / outcomes (changes directly attributable within program scope)
- Outputs (deliverables produced by the action)
- Activities (what the action implements)
- Assumptions and external factors

Drafting expectations for EU-style proposals
- The overall objective should include a rationale and clear policy relevance.
- Specific objectives should be concrete and measurable.
- Outputs should be linked to implementation packages and beneficiaries.
- Indicators should include baseline, target, and means of verification.
- Assumptions and risks should be explicitly documented.

Governance and digital service delivery focus
- User-centric service quality improvements
- Institutional capacity for implementation and monitoring
- Inter-agency coordination and process standardization
- Data governance and digital inclusion considerations

Common weaknesses to avoid
- Vague overall objective with no rationale
- Outputs not linked to specific objectives
- Indicators without baselines or verification sources
- Missing implementation responsibilities
