World Bank public sector modernization project reference patterns (seed)

Purpose
Supports retrieval for common design patterns in public sector performance and service delivery improvement interventions.

Common components in public sector modernization projects
- Institutional diagnostics and performance baseline
- Capacity building for managers and operational staff
- Process redesign and service improvement pilots
- Data systems and reporting enhancements
- Performance reviews and adaptive course correction

Design heuristics
- Phase implementation to allow diagnostics and pilot learning before scale-up
- Link training directly to process changes and management routines
- Build agency ownership through focal points and management accountability
- Use a limited number of high-value service/process pilots to demonstrate results

Illustrative risk areas
- Reform fatigue and competing priorities
- Weak administrative data quality
- Staff turnover in trained units
- Slow adoption of new reporting routines
