World Bank results framework and M&E guidance (seed summary)

Purpose
This seed summary supports retrieval for World Bank-style results framework design in governance and public sector reform projects. Replace with official World Bank guidance and project documents in production.

Typical results framework expectations
- Clear project development objective (PDO) with measurable change dimensions
- Intermediate indicators linked to implementation outputs and institutional outcomes
- Baselines, end targets, and data collection arrangements
- Realistic attribution and sequencing across implementation period

Public sector reform / service delivery design considerations
- Institutional capacity and change management are often as important as technical inputs
- Process diagnostics and baseline service metrics should inform target setting
- Indicators should capture both implementation progress and service performance outcomes
- Learning and adaptive management should be built into supervision and review cycles

Example indicator areas
- Agency performance management practices adopted
- Service delivery process time or error reduction
- Staff competency and use of management tools
- Adoption of standardized procedures and reporting routines

Common issues
- PDOs too broad for measurable tracking
- Indicators without baselines or data source clarity
- Outputs mistaken for outcomes
