Strengthen the causal link between Outputs and IRs by providing a detailed explanation of how each output will contribute to the intermediate result. Include specific mechanisms or pathways that will lead to increased AI literacy and skills among civil servants.\n2. Reassess the assumptions, particularly regarding government commitment to digital transformation. Provide evidence or a risk mitigation strategy to address potential changes in government priorities.\n3. Integrate cross-cutting themes such as gender equality and climate resilience into the proposal. Explain how the project will ensure gender-sensitive approaches in AI training and consider the environmental impact of AI technologies.",
