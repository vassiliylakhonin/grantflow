# GrantFlow Sample Artifacts (Sanitized)

This folder contains small **sanitized sample artifacts** generated with GrantFlow exporters to show artifact structure and review-package enrichments.

Included files:

- `grantflow-sample-toc-review-package.docx` - sample ToC export with citation traceability, critic findings, and review comments
- `grantflow-sample-logframe-review-package.xlsx` - sample LogFrame export with `Citations`, `Critic Findings`, and `Review Comments` sheets
- `grantflow-sample-export-payload.json` - sample review-ready export payload (sanitized)

Notes:

- These are **illustrative** examples (not real donor submissions)
- Content is intentionally short and generic to avoid sharing sensitive project material
- The files are generated by `generate_sample_artifacts.py` in the same folder
