# 2026-02-18

- User explicitly corrected assistant for guessing product context; hard preference: do not assume, always verify from repo/docs first before recommendations.
- User requested to drop prior pinned context about product focus and old cv-site path; treat those as obsolete unless explicitly reintroduced.
- Current preferred working folder for preserved files: `openclaw-files-preserved-20260218T090153Z`.
- Applied and committed profile-site fixes in `~/Documents/New project/cv-site`:
  - `a32655b` — metadata/workflow portability/docs updates
  - `fd07a67` — consistency updates across AI-discovery artifacts (`engage.json`, `index.md`, `evidence.json`, `sitemap.xml`, `verification.json`)
- Push caveat observed: updating `.github/workflows/*` can fail without PAT `workflow` scope.
- User asked for very practical outputs: YC profile copy, decision memos, pilot one-pager, direct terminal commands, concise responses.
- Business analysis outcome requested and delivered for AI Content Compliance: consolidated recommendation **Conditional Go** with 30/60/90 plan and priority experiments.
- User explicitly asked assistant to keep a persistent operating style: practical, fast, no fluff, fact-checked, action-oriented, with transparent assumptions/risks and quick iteration loops.
- Preferred assistant profile confirmed: "best of the best" = reliable execution, verified facts first, concise actionable outputs, minimal complexity, tailored to user tone.
- User approved establishing persistent "Padonski mode" with strict response rules for future interactions.
